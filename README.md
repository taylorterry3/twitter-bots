# twitter-bots
A place to keep bot(s) for Twitter/X

## wapo.py
This exists because I felt like the Washington Post never seemed to write many stories about DC itself, so I decided to start gathering the data (or at least creating a feed of it). Once I put it on Twitter it also became an experiment in attracting fake accounts and how the feed algo treats unverified bot accounts. It also once got locked for suspicious activity after I followed every news outlet and reporter in DC from the account ðŸ˜‚.

This bot is deployed to a Raspberry Pi Zero in my apartment on a cron job. The included requirements.txt is its dependencies, which are currently just yoloed into the system Python 3.
